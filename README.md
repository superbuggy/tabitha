When I can find the time, I will look for small-ish projects to build that would relate my life as a musician to my life as a coder.

For this, I wanted to apply React's philosophy of 'thinking in components' to the guitar. In terms of natural perception, I tend to think of the guitar as being composed of a small number of pieces: neck, body, headstock, tuners, and the bridge. The React philosophy of breaking down a user interface required breaking down the guitar into even smaller units, that were more conceptually user interface elements.

For this application I used `create-react-app` to build this application and make use of newer javascript features, such as the new 'instance properties' syntax.
## Planned Features

  - Fret Markers
  - Chord Selection
  - Chord Interpretation

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
